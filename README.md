# Pokedex
Uses API calls from the website https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2 to gather information about different kinds of pokemons and display it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript


### points to consider/things to work upon in the frontend
- in order to flip, on click, js needs to be used
- for that, the li needs to have a button inside it, and everything else inside the button
- onclick event handler needs to be added to the button

This is what the website looks like currently.
